Development files for the simulation of discrete circuits in MAME.

The MAME emulation platform is capable of importing a number of different
circuit design file formats.  The open source suite, KiCAD:
http://kicad-pcb.org/

and the open source suite gEDA:
http://wiki.geda-project.org/

are both currently supported.

This repository is meant to house files in at least these two formats that can
be imported and worked with in MAME.
